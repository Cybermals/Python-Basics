Lesson 1: Console Output
============================

 In this tutorial I will show you how to create a simple Python program that
displys "Hello World!" on the screen.

 Python has a function called "print" that is used to display text in a console
window. Let's take a look at the second line of the sample program:

print("Hello World!")

 Notice that the message we want to display must be enclosed in quotes. All
text data must be defined this way in Python. Each piece of data that we pass
to a function is called a parameter. In this case, we are passing one parameter
to the "print" function (our message). Parameters must always be enclosed in
parenthesis like in the example.

 The second line of the the sample program is called a docstring. It is a
description of the program. The docstring must always be enclosed in 3 quotes 
and come before our code.
