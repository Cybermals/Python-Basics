Lesson 2: Console Input
=============================

 A program that simply displays the same messages every time we run it is 
rarely useful. Let's modify the program so it can say hello to just the current
user instead of the whole world.

 The first thing we need to do is get the user's name. The "input" function can
be used to get input from the user:

name = input("Name: ")

 The first parameter of the "input" function is the prompt string. A prompt
string is some text that tells the user what kind of data to type into the
computer. After the user presses enter, the text they typed will be stored into
the variable on the left of the equal sign. A variable is a place in the memory
where a piece of data can be stored.

 After we have the user's name, we can say hi to them. Since we need to insert 
the user's name into our message, we will use something called a format string 
this time:

print("Hello {}!".format(name))

 Every pair of curly braces in our format string is essentially a "blank" where
we want to insert the value of a variable into our message. The "format"
method of a string is used to insert values into the "blanks" we have created.
A method is a function that belongs to an object. In this case the object is
our format string and the value we want to insert is the contents of our name
variable. The number of parameters that the "format" method needs is equal to 
the number of "blanks" in our format string. Also notice that we are using the 
resulting string as the first parameter of the print function.
