Lesson 3: If Blocks
===================

 So far, every program we have written has simply executed each line from top to
bottom. However, there are times when we need part of our code to only be 
executed if certain conditions are true. Let's start by getting the user to
enter a username and password:

name = input("Name: ")
pswd = input("Pswd: ")

 Once we have a username and password, we can compare them to see if they are
valid and then execute one block of code if they are valid or another block of
code if they are not valid:

if name == "Dylan" and pswd == "cheetah":
    print("Hello {}!".format(name))

else:
    print("***Access Denied***")

 The format of an if block is this:

if condition:
    #execute this code if the condition is true

else:
    #execute this code if the condition is false

 So in the sample program, we compare the name with "Dylan" and the password with
"cheetah". Then, if they both match, we say hello to the user. But if they do
not match, we say "***Access Denied***" instead. Notice that we used 2 equal
signs for each comparison:

name == "Dylan" and pswd == "cheetah"

 The double equal sign is the comparision operator. If the value on the left
is equal to the value on the right, the condition is True. Otherwise, it is
False. There are other comparision operators too: != (not equal), < (less than),
> (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to). The
keyword "and" tells Python that the condition should only be True if both
comparisions are True. Also, notice that the blocks are indented. Python requires
the contents of any type of block to be indented by an additional 4 spaces. Don't
use tabs though, because it can cause bugs in your programs.
